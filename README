Hi. This extension is meant to help people who are looking on Craigslist by allowing them to see the images on the results page instead of having to go to each of the posts.
If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, I do the twitter thing @juliancaba or you can email me at jcaballero@alum.mit.edu - I look forward to hearing from you and guarantee a response :)
